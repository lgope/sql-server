-- 1) Rename the university_shortname column to university_id in professors.

-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors

-- ###############################
-- 2) Add a foreign key on university_id column in professors that references the id column in universities.
-- Name this foreign key professors_fkey.
-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
RENAME COLUMN university_shortname TO university_id;

-- Add a foreign key on professors referencing universities

-- 3) Run the sample code and have a look at the error message.
-- What's wrong? Correct the university_id so that it actually reflects where Albert Einstein wrote his dissertation and became a professor â€“ at the University of Zurich (UZH)!
-- Try to insert a new professor
INSERT INTO professors

-- ###############################
-- 4) JOIN professors with universities on professors.university_id = universities.id, i.e., retain all records where the foreign key of professors is equal to the primary key of universities.
-- Filter for university_city = 'Zurich'.
-- Select all professors working for universities in the city of Zurich

-- 5) Add a professor_id column with integer data type to affiliations, and declare it to be a foreign key that references the id column in professors.
-- Add a professor_id column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD COLUMN professor_id integer REFERENCES professors
(id);


-- ###############################
-- 6) Rename the organization column in affiliations to organization_id.
-- Add a professor_id column

-- 8) Update the professor_id column with the corresponding value of the id column in professors.

-- 11) Have a look at the existing foreign key constraints by querying table_constraints in information_schema.
-- Identify the correct constraint name
SELECT constraint_name, table_name, constraint_type

-- Drop the right foreign key constraint

FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';
